## Comments by Shubhandra

Just run 'npm install' to install all the required packages in the root folder.
Node API is in the 'backend' folder to run it type 'nodemon backend/app.js' and press enter. I have already configured the server and database so you donn't have to worry about it.
NPM Packages for Node API are express, mongodb, mongoose, bcryptjs, validator, jsonwebtoken, Dotenv, Nodemon.
NPM Packages for angular are none yet but we will install Angular Material and Bootstrap for UI development.

Note - If you need to install another package discuss it with the team before doing that.
     - After completing your modules test it properly before raising a pull request.
